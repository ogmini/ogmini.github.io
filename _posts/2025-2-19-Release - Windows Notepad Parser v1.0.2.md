Releasing Version 1.0.2 of Windows Notepad Parser [https://github.com/ogmini/Notepad-State-Library/releases/tag/v1.0.2](https://github.com/ogmini/Notepad-State-Library/releases/tag/v1.0.2). This new version includes a .NET 8.0 dependent version and a standalone version that doesn't need .NET 8.0 installed on the system. There is also a minimal branch that doesn't include the ability to generate a GIF from the changes. The noticeable change is some formatting of the CSV files to reorder and remove unnecessary columns. 

I still plan on writing a KAPE Target and Module.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Feel free to reach out on GitHub with an Issue or on LinkedIn.
