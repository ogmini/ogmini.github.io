So, our team has already finished the 6 challenges for the Hackers N' Hops CTF. I stole sometime during vacation to participate as we collaboratively solved a few of them on Discord. When I get back, I'll be attempting to solve the ones I didn't do with them. 

I like this CTF and will definitely be participating in the future. It isn't a huge timesink while definitely providing some learning opportunities. I enjoyed the WEB and Forensics challenge the most. It was fun working together to solve them as we threw out ideas on how to attack the challenge.
