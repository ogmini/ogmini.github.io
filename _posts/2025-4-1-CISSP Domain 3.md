- Privacy By Design
- Security Models
    - Layer Based Models
        - Bell-LaPadula + Biba = Lipner
    - Rule Based Models
- Certification vs Accreditation (Accreditation is the sign off on certification)
- Security Control Frameworks (ITIL, HIPAA, FedRAMP, etc)
- Security Capabilities of systems
    - This is just a rehash of all my Comp Sci, Operating Systems, etc learning
- Vulnerability assessment and mitigation
    - SaaS, PaaS, IaaS
    - OWASP
    - IoT
    - Injection
    - Validation
