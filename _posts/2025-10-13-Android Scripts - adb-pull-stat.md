Finally got around to finishing up a Python script that I am creatively calling "adb-pull-stat.py" that I talked about in a previous [post](https://ogmini.github.io/2025/10/03/Filesystem-Timestamp-ADB-Script.html). It is nothing fancy and was written to fill a need I had. The script has been published to a GitHub repo - [https://github.com/ogmini/Forensic-ADB-Scripts](https://github.com/ogmini/Forensic-ADB-Scripts). I have a sneaky feeling that I might be writing more "utility" scripts as I continue looking and Android devices and they'll be finding their way into that repo. 

Suggestions and critiques are always welcome!
