BSides NYC 0x05 hosted a few different CTFs and [CTFd](https://bsidesnyc.ctfd.io/challenges) put a call out for volunteers to submit a few CTF Challenges. I decided to give it a shot and submitted three forensic type challenges. It was a fun experience as I have never written a CTF challenge. The CTFd people were a great bunch to work with!

Interestingly, making the challenges really helped cement some understanding of the forensic artifacts involved. It’s one thing to find and read forensic artifacts; it’s another to create or change them so they show a flag like `flag{find me}`. I learned a lot in the process of making the challenges. 

I believe you can still find my challenges at [https://bsidesnyc.ctfd.io/challenges](https://bsidesnyc.ctfd.io/challenges). When I get a chance, I might throw up a repo to hold any challenges I write. The three challenges I wrote are:

1. Secret Map - Scratching the surface
2. Secret Map - Matroyshka?
3. Jedis use Windows Notepad?

They all had a Star Wars theme just for fun. The Secret Map challenges centered on a digital image and the last challenge involved Windows Notepad. 

If you tried them during BSides NYC 0x05 or after, I'd love to hear your feedback.
