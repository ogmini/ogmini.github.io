I'm pretty sure I can talk about this. At the end of 2024, I submitted my research on Windows Notepad to [DFIR Review](https://dfir.pubpub.org/) and made a [post](https://ogmini.github.io/2024/12/01/Is-that-Windows-Notepad-window-really-empty.html) about it. I recently got notification that my submission was accepted!

I just sent a cleaned up document for some additions and a final review. Excited to see it published at some point in the future. I will have some pretty large revisions for the future as this was written prior to the Rewrite AI and Markdown features.  

DFIR Review is made up of all volunteers and they definitely put a lot of work into reviewing submissions. Utmost admiration and respect to their work. I would love to see if I could volunteer in the future.
