Short post, just spent a few hours driving up to Albany, NY and I just checked into my hotel. All ready to attend the 2025 New York State Cybersecurity Conference. A lot of interesting talks and presentation. 

I'm planning to attend presentations on:

- NIST CSF 2.0
- Malicious AI
- AI in DFIR and Cybersecurity
- Insider Threats
- Building a culture of security

I did get a chance to update the documentation for the Remote Desktop Manager in the Kape Target. For now, I have a [page](https://ogmini.github.io/research) that has sections for everything that I've researched. Each of those sections has links to the individual posts. I should still write summary posts to make it a little easier to consume.
