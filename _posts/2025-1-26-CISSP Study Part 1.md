Time to get serious and study to pass the CISSP examination. Outlining my plan and giving myself a deadline will keep me motivated and on track. I picked up a copy of Destination CISSP 2nd Edition to serve as my study material since it had been updated for the revised exam. 

The exam consists of 8 Domains with some definite crossover with material I had for the CSSLP examination. My plan is to take ~1 week per domain and pass the CISSP examination in April. In order to keep me accountable and on track, every Sunday I will post a summary of what I've studied that week.
