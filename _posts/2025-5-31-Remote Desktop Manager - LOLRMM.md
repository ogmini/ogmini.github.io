As I continue to explore various tools such as Remote Desktop Manager. I feel it is very important to add to the existing knowledge base with open documentation and contributing to open source projects. 

I've already submitted a Target to KapeFiles which I still need to update with links to my various posts. I have been contemplating the best way to "centralize" those various posts. This blog is really meant to be rather informal and this is evidenced by the various Part # posts. Ideally, maybe each topic with its various parts can be ultimately summarized and contained into one page when I'm "done". 

I did notice that a great website called [https://lolrmm.io/](https://lolrmm.io/) has essentially a stub for Remote Desktop Manager. Would be trivial to contribute to the yaml file and fill in a bunch of the information. Most of it already exists in my previous posts. The more places that people can find information the better. 

I'm surprised that rdcman is not on LOLRMM. Maybe it isn't considered a remote monitoring and management tool? Chrome Remote Desktop is listed though. Possibly another thing to contribute.
