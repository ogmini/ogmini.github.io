Just finished "Anatomy of an Attack: Ransomware Workshop (IR224)" offered by CISA in coordination with Cybervance and Blue Cape Security. I talked about these in a previous [post](https://ogmini.github.io/2025/01/04/Certification-Training-Plans-2025.html) and would encourage those eligible to register.

In the course we talked about:

- Attacker Tactics
- Lifecycle of an attack
- LOLBins
- C2 Frameworks
- Incident Response

## Thoughts

This was a great course and my only complaint would be that it was only 2 days long. There was a TON of information thrown at us. I had never spun up a C2 Framework and we were able to play around with [http://www.powershellempire.com/](http://www.powershellempire.com/) in a lab environment to emulate how an attacker would leverage access.

We also played around with LOLBins and other tools such as mimikatz. This was a nice refresher from some of my previous classwork. This was in the context of recon and lateral movement. 

The second day revolved around being in the shoes of the blue team and investigating a ransomware incident. We leveraged tools such as the venerable KAPE, Splunk, Security Onion, and talked about Velociraptor. This all culminated in a very quick CTF/Challenge in which we were given information about an incident and cut loose on a lab environment to start our incident response. I must say, everytime I do one of these CTF/Challenges I learn something new and make more connections.
