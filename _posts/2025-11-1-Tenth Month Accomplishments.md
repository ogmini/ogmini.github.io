Looking back on October had me diving heavily into Android Forensics. I also of course gave my talk at BSides NYC 0x05. Wasn't the best talk; but I learned a lot and it was an enjoyable experience. Hopefully this won't be my last. The volunteers and organizers do an amazing job at running the event. I finished out the last of the After Action Reports (AAR) for the challenges that I was able to complete during the time period for BelkaCTF 7. I do intend on doing AARs for the other challenges. 

Going back to Android Forensics, I'm excited to give [https://github.com/prosch88/ALEX](https://github.com/prosch88/ALEX) a try in my research. I'm still going to take a deeper look at the DJI Fly App; but it requires me to actually USE and FLY the DJI Neo in a meaningful fashion. The weather has not been conducive for that so far. 

My interest was also recently piqued by Copilot+ features in Windows 11. This would require buying a new laptop to test on though and I probably have enough projects to last without introducing another one.
