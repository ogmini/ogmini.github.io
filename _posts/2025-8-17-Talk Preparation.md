Taking a break from Volatlity 3 and MemProcFS by doing some more preparation for my upcoming talk at BSides NYC. My rough draft consists of 8 slides including title, intro, and Q&A for a 25 minute talk. Should be a nice, succinct and informative talk. I need to make them look nicer and more engaging with color/pictures as they're just currently textual talking points. I'm also incredibly nervous as this will be a day of many firsts:

- First time attending BSides NYC
- First time attending a Cybersecurity Conference
- First time giving a talk on a Digital Forensic topic

I've attended other conferences related to IT in Higher Education and I've given talks at them about my work in software development and project management. I feel like I'm pretty comfortable at talking to a crowd on those types of subjects. My most recent talk was on the importance of collaboration during the software development cycle and approaches for success.

One really nice thing that BSides NYC is doing this year is their Speaker Mentorship Program. Looking forward to participating and working with them on that program.
