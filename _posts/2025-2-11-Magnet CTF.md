It is CTF time!

## Magnet 2025 CTF

Magnet Forensics is holding their [CTF](https://magnetvirtualsummit.com/capture-the-flag/) on February 13, 2025 from 11AM-2PM EST. As this is during work hours for me, I will only be able to try it after the timed event is over. Luckily, they do keep the CTF and scoreboard up for most of the month. I've prepped my virtual machine, downloaded the image files, verified their hashes, and I'm currently processing the files in Magnet Axiom. Magnet has provided a temporary license to use during the competition. 

We've been given four images:
- Android 
    - Includes a Google Takeout 
- Chromebook 
    - Includes a Google Takeout
- iPhone
- Windows 11

I'm hoping to get acquainted with the images and what they contain later tonight and tomorrow before the challenge questions are posted. 

Jessica Hyde and Kevin Pagano gave a great CTF Workshop for participants. Some great information especially for someone who has never done a Magnet CTF. 

## Belkasoft CTF 01

I have tackled the Belkasoft CTF 01: Insider Threat and noticed that some of the challenge questions are no longer solvable as they relied on websites that no longer exist. Some of the information was retrievable using the Internet Archive Wayback Machine and other files are no longer retrievable. I am currently in the process of writing up a report detailing the timeline of actions on the laptop.
