I stalled out HARD in studying for my CISSP and my timeline fell apart. I had [planned](https://ogmini.github.io/2025/01/26/CISSP-Study-Part-1.html) on being done with all 8 domains by this weekend and that is definitely not the case. I left off having [finished](https://ogmini.github.io/2025/02/03/CISSP-Domain-1-and-2.html) Domains 1 and 2.

The new plan is to focus fully on this and not get sidetracked by other interesting DFIR projects until this is complete. The following future batch of posts are going to be recaps/notes of whatever I have studied that day for my CISSP exam. Sorry if this is boring; but hopefully this might help someone else who might be studying for the exam.

This also carves a little bit of time to slowly in the background work on reverse engineering that rewrite API without the pressure of posting about it. [https://ogmini.github.io/2025/03/29/Reverse-Engineering-Rewrite-API.html](https://ogmini.github.io/2025/03/29/Reverse-Engineering-Rewrite-API.html). I will still do a writeup when that is completed.
