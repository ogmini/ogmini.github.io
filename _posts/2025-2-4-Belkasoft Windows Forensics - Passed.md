Got the results back from the Belkasoft Windows Forensics course/exam and I passed. I already gave my thoughts on the actual course [https://ogmini.github.io/2025/01/25/Belkasoft-Windows-Forenics-Part-2.html](https://ogmini.github.io/2025/01/25/Belkasoft-Windows-Forenics-Part-2.html).

The exam itself was short and consisted of questions based on what you learned in the course and practical questions that involved using Belkasoft X or other forensic tools. The practical questions focused on finding or reporting back on digital artifacts in the provided images.

Again, an enjoyable course that served as a good refresher and a way to learn how to use Belkasoft X.
