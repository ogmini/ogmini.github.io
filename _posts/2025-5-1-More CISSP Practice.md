Not a very interesting post today. Spent the evening doing some practice questions in the CISSP book. I always find the scenario questions with names and fake companies funny. I do like them though, as they are a good way realistic question/way for people to think about situations and how to handle them. 

Finished writing a Module for KAPE to leverage my Windows Notepad Parser. I want to do a little more testing and clean it up a bit just to make sure it complies with the project standards. There is another Module that leverages another application to parse Windows Notepad but it only handles tab state files. There is potentially useful information to be gained from the Window State files. Giving people more Module options doesn't hurt.
