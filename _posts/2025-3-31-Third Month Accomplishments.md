The third month of the Zeltser Challenge has been tough as I'm fully getting into my role as CIO, restructuring the department, and getting acquainted with everything involved in this new role. This new role is very taxing mentally as I'm trying to juggle so many different projects, problems, and goals. Despite all this, I've still somehow managed kept to my daily post cadence.

Looking back at the highlights for the third month:

- Released v1.0.3 of Windows Notepad Parser
- Released research notes about artifacts for Windows Notepad - Rewrite functionality
- Finished all the AAR/Writeups for the Magnet Virtual Summit 2025 CTF
- Won 2 of David Cowen's Sunday Funday challenges on SSH Artifacts on Windows and Linux

This list feels so short; but the AAR/Writeups for the MVS 2025 CTF took up a lot of posts and time. Going back over them revealed some good lessons learned with the top lesson being not get get fixated.

I still need to finish my writeup for the first Belkasoft CTF.
