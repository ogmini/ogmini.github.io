Deadline for submission is July 19th, 2025. Just putting some last minute polish and reading over the description and outline. Imposter syndrome is kicking into high gear. I just need to remember that I'm just talking about MY experiences and MY thoughts on the subject. I am not trying to sell anything or convince anyone of anything. 

Even if the talk isn't accepted. I'll make it into a series of posts as it helps solidify what I have learned from my experiences.
