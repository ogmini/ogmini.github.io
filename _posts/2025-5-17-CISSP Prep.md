Spent some of the day prepping for my CISSP exam. Still chipping away at the practice exam questions. I have to buckle down and just rip out the rest of the questions and schedule the exam. I know the material; just need the confidence. 

Building upon my research into [RDCMan](https://ogmini.github.io/research). I'm going to start taking a look at [Remote Desktop Manager](https://devolutions.net/remote-desktop-manager/) from Devolutions. A similar but more feature packed alternative to RDCMan that has both a free and paid version. I'll be starting with the free version. 

Still haven't heard back about my report about the bug in RDCMan 3.1. [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/2264786/rdcman-recent-servers-broken-in-3-1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/2264786/rdcman-recent-servers-broken-in-3-1)
