I've started studying for the CISSP exam and what follows are a recap and notes on Domains 1 and 2.

    - Different types of data (3P, IP, SD)
    - Different authorities
- Risk Management
    - Value/Valuation of assets
    - Risk Analysis
    - Treament (Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate, Accept)
- Threat Modelling
    - PASTA
    - STRIDE

## Domain 2 - Asset Security
