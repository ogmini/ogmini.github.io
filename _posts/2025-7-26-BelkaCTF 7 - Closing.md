I think I'm done with the challenges. I have theories on how to attack some of them; but they aren't working out. I'm currently sitting at 25 and the top individual from the USA on the scoreboard. I'm sure that will change as I sleep tonight. Looking forward to seeing the solutions and I will be posting my own writeups in the future. As always, there are multiple ways to solve a challenge.
