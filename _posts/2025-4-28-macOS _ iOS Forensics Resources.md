With the impending delivery of my new Macbook Air, I'm compiling and reading resources on macOS forensics. I'd love it if anyone had any other suggestions for resources!

- [https://www.mac4n6.com/](https://www.mac4n6.com/)
- SANS FOR518 - Can't justify the cost
- [iOS Forensics for Investigators](https://www.amazon.com/iOS-Forensics-Investigators-forensics-extracting/dp/1803234083/130-8858987-9027650)
- [Learning iOS Forensics](https://books.apple.com/us/book/learning-ios-forensics-second-edition/id1152177424)
- The old school way by just diving in, exploring, asking questions, and finding answers.
