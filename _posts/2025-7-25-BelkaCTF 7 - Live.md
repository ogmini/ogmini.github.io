Short post today as I'm in the middle of the BelkaCTF 7. Making slow progress in the challenges. I'm currently working on #7 which is listed as Hard. It definitely is... A little bit stumped on how to attack this one. Is it OSINT? Memory Analysis? API? I might have to skip this one. Looks like I'm in good company as 6 other people are at the same exact stage as me at the moment and a bunch of people have already skipped it.
