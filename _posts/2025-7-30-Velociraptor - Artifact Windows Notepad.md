Just submitted an Artifact to the Velociraptor Artifact Exchange for Windows Notepad that leverages my [WindowsNotepadParser](https://github.com/ogmini/Notepad-State-Library). I'm pretty sure the YAML can be significantly improved. I'm hoping for some feedback and suggestions. It works fine; but requires creating a folder on the client to save the csv files. There should be a way to save them to the temp directory. I wasn't able to get that to work though.

Ideally, Velociraptor should not need WindowsNotepadParser as it has a built in [Binary Parser](https://docs.velociraptor.app/docs/forensic/binary/) and the Artifact would be able to do everything natively. Currently the Binary Parser does not appear to support ULEB128/LEB128. I've started to poke around to see if that can be added with the caveat being that I have no experience with Go. I believe I'd have to make changes/contributions to [https://github.com/Velocidex/vtypes](https://github.com/Velocidex/vtypes).
