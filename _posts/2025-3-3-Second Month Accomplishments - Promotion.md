This second month of the Zeltser Challenge continues to be very fruitful and motivating. It has NOT been easy to post every day; but I still haven't missed a post since the start. 

Looking back at the highlights for the second month:

- I started studying for my CISSP. This has stalled somewhat.
- Started to dip my toes in CTFs
- Released GaslitPad
- Verified Notepad++ artifacts
- Competed in the Magnet Virtual Summit 2025 CTF and placed 15th overall in the individual competition
- Started researching Visual Studio Code
- Contributed to some KAPE Targets
- Released updated version of Windows Notepad Parser
- Ongoing CTF writeups

The ooo shiny problem is still strong! I need to wrapup the CTF writeups and finish my look at Visual Studio Code artifacts. I also need to finish the report for one of the older Belkasoft CTFs that I posted about. 

The biggest news and my new challenge is my promotion to Interim CIO effective today.
