Been enjoying the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2025! Got past Act 1 and I've finished 2/7 of Act 2. We can't do any write ups yet so I'll talk in general terms about my impressions so far.

- Good challenges to give introduction to using Azure CLI.
- I got stuck on one easy challenge because of a silly typo :x
- Another one I over-complicated and solved after coming back later with a clearer mind

I'm hoping I can finish Act 2 over the weekend and maybe get a start on Act 3. The difficulty will definitely ramp up though.
