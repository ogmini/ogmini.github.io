The first month of the Zeltser Challenge issued by David Cowen has been very educational and challenging! I have not missed a day though I totally threw my posting topic "plan" out the window and it has ended up being far more organic and closer to a diary of what I'm working on. So far, I know of the following fellow participants:

- Oleg Skulkin - [https://www.knowyouradversary.ru/](https://www.knowyouradversary.ru/)
- Matt Edmondson - [https://www.argeliuslabs.com/blog/](https://www.argeliuslabs.com/blog/)

Spotlights on the participants can be found at [https://www.hecfblog.com/search/label/zeltser%20challenge](https://www.hecfblog.com/search/label/zeltser%20challenge). 

So what have I done and accomplished in my first month?

- About to release my first POC Malware called GaslitPad
- Participated in two Sunday Funday challenges
- Won a Sunday Funday Challenge - [https://www.hecfblog.com/2025/01/daily-blog-721-solution-saturday-11825.html](https://www.hecfblog.com/2025/01/daily-blog-721-solution-saturday-11825.html)
- Researching and understanding LevelDB / IndexedDB from a digital forensic standpoint
- Reviewed two of my Digital Forensic Science courses at Champlain College
- Attended and provided takeaways about three CISA Incident Response trainings
- Discussed the recent Powerschool Hack
- Continued work and research on Windows Notepad 
- Started building a new Homelab and research setup
- Completed the Belkasoft Windows Forensics Training course

One of the biggest hurdles I have is this feeling of so many shiny objects. I want to do/learn everything at once and end up constantly switching between tasks. As an example, the Sunday Funday challenges are very informative while also being very time intensive. Part of that problem comes down to experience and knowing how to start tackling a problem and focusing down. I'm still at the stage where I'm unsure of the best approach and where to devote time. Moving forward, I'm not going to attempt to participate in every Sunday Funday. Subsequently, I dropped working on my Windows Notepad research and projects and that is something I want to "complete". I haven't made any progress on the topic of regression testing and cataloging the changes of the state files between versions. 

I also have to remember I have a day job leading an IT department.
