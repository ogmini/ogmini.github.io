With the introduction of Markdown support we have a new setting in the `settings.dat` file to enable/disable the Formatting options. Using Registry Explorer we can take a look and see it:

![FormattingEnabled](/images/windowsnotepad/FormattingEnabled.png)

| KeyName | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Formatting Enabled | 0x5f5e10b | 0 = Off / 1 = On |

More to come as I get more time to dig in.
