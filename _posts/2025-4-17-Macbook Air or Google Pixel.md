![MacBook vs Pixel](/images/memes/macbookvspixel.jpg)

All my IT career has been centered around Windows and Linux. I have had very little exposure to MacOS beyond random use and searching for answers to help friends and family. The recent [Sunday Funday Challenge](https://www.hecfblog.com/2025/04/daily-blog-807-sunday-funday-41325.html) reminded me of this fact and it is a definite "hole" in my knowledge. It isn't good enough to only have theory on how to perform forensics on MacOS. 

I've also been contemplating getting another Google Pixel phone to play around with GrapheneOS and its implications on Mobile Forensics. I don't purport to have the skills to extract data from a locked phone. It would still be insightful to extract data from an unlocked phone using the standard ADB. 

This leaves me with a choice... Buy a new Macbook Air or a used Google Pixel. I'm only going to do one as I for sure don't have time to look into both. The Macbook Air will be more useful in my day to day and a new/light laptop would be nice over my venerable Lenovo T470. Using the Macbook Air daily would also assist in learning the ins and outs. The used Google Pixel would be much cheaper but I don't really have a use for another phone.  Additionally, GrapheneOS is not very likely to be encountered in the wild. Niche knowledge vs widespread knowledge.
