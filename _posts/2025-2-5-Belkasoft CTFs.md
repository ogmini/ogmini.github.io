After completing the Windows Forensics with Belkasoft certification, I learned that Belkasoft has a bunch of different CTF challenges that are still available to practice and hone my skills. I also want to use this as an opportunity to improve my report writing and presentation skills. It is one thing to find evidence and another to present it to a non-technical audience. The plan is to start on the first one and just make my way through the list. You can find their CTFs at [https://belkasoft.com/ctf](https://belkasoft.com/ctf).

So what is the first CTF challenge?! Quoted from their website:

Just before the date, the source code and technical documents ended up in their competitor's hands. The company suspects a recently hired developer and obtained a copy of his corporate laptop HDD. You are going to analyze the image and support the suspicion with evidence extracted from the laptop...
