My talk proposal was accepted a few days back! Excited and nervous at the same time. I'm not sure how much is appropriate to talk about yet; but I'm now focused on polishing my slides and material. I'll definitely be practicing with some friends as an audience. 

More details to come. Hopefully I'll get to meet some of you in person.

Mike Cohen, who is the principal developer of Velociraptor,added support for varints soon after submitting my [Issue](https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor/issues/4372) to the repository. I'll need to build from source to start developing an Artifact that can natively parse the Windows Notepad state files. It will be handy to look at his [commit](https://github.com/Velocidex/vtypes/pull/23/files) on the vtypes repository to see how he implemented it for learning purposes.
