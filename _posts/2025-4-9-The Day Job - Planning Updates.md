For every organization with important assets, there should be security/DR plans in place that are maintained, updated, and tested. As part of my recent role change to Interim CIO, I'm reviewing all of our security/DR plans with my team. Without going into much detail, all of our plans and information are documented but are a bit disjointed and in need of a polishing to make them easier to follow. It is handy that I've been studying for my CISSP certification as this exercise overlaps completely with the material. Knowledge in practice as they say. We are a small team in the grand scheme and I have to wear multiple hats including that of the CIO and CISO.
