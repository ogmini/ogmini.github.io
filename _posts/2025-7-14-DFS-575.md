Continuation from [Part 9](https://ogmini.github.io/2025/06/26/DFS-570.html) looking back at my coursework in the Master's Degree in Digital Forensic Science. In this post, I'll be talking about DFS-575 Digital Forensics for Civil Litigation.

## DFS-575 Digital Forensics for Civil Litigation

Similar to DFS-570, this class mainly focused on various discussions on laws, rules, and regulations that apply to civil litigation. 

Topics of discussion included:

- Internal HR Investigations
- Cross Border 
- eDiscovery
- Litigation Holds
- Spoilation of evidence
- Due diligence

One takeaway was the possibility of a civil case changing into a criminal case. Just because a case might be private doesn't mean that an investigator can treat the evidence with less care. 

In my professional career, I spent a year working at a Law Firm in charge of maintaing and upgrading their document management system (DMS). I wish I had had more exposure to and asked asked more questions of my eDsicovery coworkers.

The only class for me to look back at is the Capstone. I will also be writing a post pulling this all together and my overall thoughts on the experience.
