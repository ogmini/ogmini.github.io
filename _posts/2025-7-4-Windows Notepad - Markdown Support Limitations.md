Markdown Support is pretty limited in Windows Notepad. You have a toolbar at the top that lets you choose your formatting options. Most helpfully at the bottom is a toggle between "Formatted" and "Markdown Syntax". This lets you see and manually write the Markdown syntax.

This of course begged the question, what happens if I throw unsupported Markdown into a file and open it with Windows Notepad. Answer: It defaults to unformatted text and does not render any Markdown formatting. No fun :(
