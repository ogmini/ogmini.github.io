Continuing with my writeups on my "fails" or the ones I just couldn't figure out in the timeframe alloted. I want to talk about how I went about trying to solve the challenge and where I went wrong. This should help me in the future by highlighting weaknesses and areas for improvement. Each post will focus on just one "fail" challenge. You can find all my writeups [here](https://ogmini.github.io/ctf).

## Capital Offense

Title: 100X Scale  
Description: Decode the secret message

This challenge was under the Cipher section and worth 50 points.  

### My Process

- From reading previous CTF writeups I knew from the hint that this would be related somehow to the spectrogram. 
    
### Actual Solution

For this solution, I appreciated the writeup from Kevin Pagano at Stark4n6 [https://www.stark4n6.com/2025/03/magnet-virtual-summit-2025-ctf-ciphers.html](https://www.stark4n6.com/2025/03/magnet-virtual-summit-2025-ctf-ciphers.html). He makes it sound so easy! Which it is if you have a methodology to follow. Examining the spectrogram shows very definitive frequencies at regularly spaced intervals. Each frequency is a number that represents Hertz and going by the hint of 100X scale, we should divide the frequency by 100. We have a second different encoding obscuring the flag which is ASCII this time. CyberChef using the decimal conversion can convert the numbers to text.  

### Lessons Learned

1. Get familiar with Audacity, Sonic Visualizer, or other spectrogram analyzer.
2. Again, layers of ciphers/encoding
