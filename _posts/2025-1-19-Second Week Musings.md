It has been a busy week with multiple big changes on the horizon. Definitely feel like I have too many irons in the fire. Hopefully by next month, I can talk about them. Still fighting that imposter syndrome. What have I been able to accomplish this week though?

I was able to carve out sometime to take on David Cowen's challenge and my submission was picked! [https://www.hecfblog.com/2025/01/daily-blog-721-solution-saturday-11825.html](https://www.hecfblog.com/2025/01/daily-blog-721-solution-saturday-11825.html)

There are a few aspects of my answer and what I found that bother me. I'm hoping to continue exploring SRUM to get a better understanding of its operation. I noted these in my [post](https://ogmini.github.io/2025/01/13/David-Cowen-Sunday-Funday-SRUM.html) as areas of future interest:

- SRUM records stored in the Registry prior to flush
- Errors from RegistryExplorer / SrumECmd / any tool that uses the RegistryHive library from Eric Zimmerman
- ForegroundNumberOfFlushes - something about it still bothers me. I want to perform more testing on this.
- Try to figure out how to isolate SRUM data as much as possible

I've made no progress on my Notepad State Library or associated projects as I got sidetracked by exploring [MSLab](https://ogmini.github.io/2025/01/17/MSLab-Part-1.html). I also started the build on a new server.
