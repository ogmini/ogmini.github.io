Parts have started to arrive for the next iteration of my next server. I'll be keeping the same software stack as the current server and obviously repurposing the current server for other duties. In Part 3, I'll talk about the thought process that led me to this configuration and what other options I investigated.

## Hardware Specs

- AMD Ryzen 9 5900XT
- EVGA CLC240 AIO
- MSI MAG B550 Tomahawk ATX
- 128GB (4x32GB) DDR4-3600 TEAMGROUP T-Create Expert DIMM
- Nvidia GTX 1070
- 2TB Western Digital Blue NVMe
- Corsair RM750x PSU
- Storage TBD
- Lian Li Lancool 207

I'm reusing some parts that I or friends had laying around from older computers that got upgraded.

This isn't a huge change from the [current system](https://ogmini.github.io/2025/01/12/Homelab-Current-Setup.html) as they are both AM4 based. But it should address my only complaints about the current system.

Oh also, the case is very gamer RGB and cheap. I won't be hooking up the RGB.
