Belkasoft recently launched some new training related to effectively using AI in DFIR. [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/belkasoft_dfir-digitalforensics-ai-activity-7390772730951839744-fZum?](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/belkasoft_dfir-digitalforensics-ai-activity-7390772730951839744-fZum). When I signed up the course was free for a short time. I'm intrigued to see how the course presents using AI. I continue to be very cautious about AI and its use. Both from an environmental and human impact viewpoint. After I complete the course I will be sure to post my thoughts.
