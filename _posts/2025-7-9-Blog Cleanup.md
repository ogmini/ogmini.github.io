Spent today cleaning up the blog and fixing some Markdown syntax via Linting. All the tags should be fixed and working now. Also worked on updating the documentation on [https://github.com/ogmini/Notepad-State-Library](https://github.com/ogmini/Notepad-State-Library) to be inline with all the research I've posted on this blog. One thing that I really need to finish is the Changelog for Windows Notepad that I left off with this [post](https://ogmini.github.io/2025/04/27/Windows-Notepad-Version-Changes-(11.2049.9.0).html).
