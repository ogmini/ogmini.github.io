This blog will document my exploration of Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) as I make the transition into this exciting field. More importantly, it will serve as a centralized place to store my notes, observations, and learnings.

## Ongoing Projects

I’ve already released my research on Windows Notepad and a tool to collect and parse its artifacts. You can check it out here: [Notepad State Library on GitHub](https://github.com/ogmini/Notepad-State-Library). I’ll be posting regular updates on the project, including new findings, before consolidating the research into the repository. Some key areas I’m focusing on for this project include:

- Updating at new versions of Windows Notepad are released
  - Documentation of changes introduced by new versions of Windows Notepad
- Integration into KapeFiles
- Proof-of-Concept Malware: A library to manipulate state files for testing and research

## Other Ongoing Endeavors

Beyond this project, I’ve got a few other things on my plate as I work toward my career goals:

- CISSP Certification: I’m currently studying for my CISSP and will be sharing my progress along the way.
- Practical Malware Analysis & Triage: I’m taking TCM Security’s course, which is enhancing my skills in malware analysis. I’ll be posting about the key takeaways and how I’m applying them in real-world scenarios.
- Capture the Flag (CTF) Challenges: I’m also participating in various CTFs to expand my practical knowledge in DFIR. Expect updates on my experiences, strategies, and solutions.

I’ll be writing blog posts related to these topics as I continue to learn and grow in the DFIR field.
