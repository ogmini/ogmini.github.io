Like many fields, DFIR consists of so many different areas of expertise and knowledge. Some people focus purely on research and others on practice. There are experts in mobile devices, desktops, cloud, network, and other IOT devices. Individuals may work on reverse engineering malware, writing detection rules, and even negotiating with adversaries. There is even the hardware side of DFIR looking at exploits against electronic hardware. I'm sure I may have missed a few, but the main point is that for every technology, DFIR has a role to play and will need experts.

This Wide World of DFIR is one thing that I've been tackling in trying to figure out my next career steps and part of the reason I'm doing this daily post challenge. It will hopefully expose me to various different areas and fields. Ultimately, helping me find something that interests me.

These are some areas that I have some interest in exploring and knowing more about:

- Performing forensics and incident response (Generalized)
- Writing forensic tools
  - Forensic research possibly goes hand in hand with this
- Malware reverse engineering
  - This tickles my developer brain

So far, I've done a few things related to the first two interests and continue to work on them. In terms of Malware reverse engineering, I am enrolled in TCM Security's Practical Malware Analysis & Triage Certification. I have not made the time to seriously start on it; but it is on my list for later in the year.

It will be an interesting time once I start seriously looking for a career change...
