> What Hex Editor(s) do you prefer to use?

Personally, I've used [010 Editor](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/) and [ImHex](https://imhex.werwolv.net/). I tend to use both while working on files as they give me different views and insights. Keep in mind that ImHex is open source and free to use while 010 Editor is paid. Both are full featured and will get the job done. They both offer pattern files/templates to more easily deciper files with highlighting and data translation. 

I've worked on and submitted pattern files and binary template files to both ImHex and 010 Editor for Windows Notepad. They both have a pretty extensive repository that can be used to understand common files. 

I'd love to hear about other Hex Editors you might prefer or any tips/tricks for the ones I currently use.
