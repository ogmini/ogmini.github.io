Another month down and we had a few missed posts due to vacation just as I predicted in my last monthly accomplishment post. 

July was a month of ups and downs. At some points I had a feeling of being overstretched. Had a post about that here [https://ogmini.github.io/2025/07/11/All-The-Things.html](https://ogmini.github.io/2025/07/11/All-The-Things.html). This feeling hasn't really subsided; but I'm more comfortable with accepting it and picking what I want to pursue. This isn't a job, so I feel free to jump back and forth. That is the point of my "exploration". See where my interests lead me. 

Beyond that, made more progress on Windows Notepad which introduced limited Markdown support recently. Interesting how it impacts the TabState files. 

Pretty much finished reverse engineering the data types related to app containers and their registry hives. The only one eluding me is the Composite Key. 

I participated in the HackersNHops CTF and BelkaCTF. I finished 27th in the BelkaCTF and I'm currently doing my writeups for each Task. Very enjoyable and learned a lot. 

In more exciting news, my paper submission to DFIR Review is in the final stages and I'm looking forward to that going live. Additionally, it looks like my CFP submission to BSides was also accepted. 

August is already shaping up to be another good month.
