Forgive the late recap! To say that the last 2 months have been busy and full of change would be an understatement. Back at the start of 2025, [David Cowen](https://www.hecfblog.com/) put forth the Zeltser Challenge. I jumped in and this post will provide a little recap of highlights and what I got out of the challenge. Not everything went according to plan.

I wrote 274 blog posts. With a majority of the "missed" posts happening later in the year. I did not end up following my plan of having different topics for every day. Instead, I followed my interests wherever they took me.

Standout topics in my blog posts include:

- Windows Notepad Research
- CTFs (Magnet, BelkaCTF, etc)
- BSides NYC Presentation
- DFIR Review Publication
- Various contributions to DFIR tools

The Zeltser Challenge really encouraged and forced me to engage at practical level with various DF/IR topics. This went far beyond just reading about the topics. I researched, tested, and documented my findings on various digital artifacts. One resulting in publication with [DFIR Review](https://dfir.pubpub.org/pub/wmhy8t6v/release/6) and multiple contributions to various projects to support analysis. It also helped me make connections with other people in the DF/IR field.

Moving into 2026, I will continue to explore my interests and post what I find and learn. I won't be trying to post daily though. It was a TOUGH challenge made more difficult due to being thrust into the role of CIO at my old job in March of 2025. Big changes in responsibility and stress. As I grew into the role and found my stride, I was able to restart searching for my career change/pivot. Which leads to the biggest accomplishment for me of this whole Zeltser Challenge. I will be starting soon at my new position as an IT Cybersecurity Lead.
