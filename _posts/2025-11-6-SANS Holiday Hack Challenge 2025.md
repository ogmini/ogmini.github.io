I somehow missed that this was starting already. The SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2025 is live now at [https://www.sans.org/cyber-ranges/holiday-hack-challenge#play](https://www.sans.org/cyber-ranges/holiday-hack-challenge#play). We'll see how far I can get this year. This is more of a general Cybersecurity CTF as opposed to a Digital Forensic CTF. I do like that they added a "CTF Style" as it was kind of tedious moving around the map. I can just focus on the challenges.
