Short post for today as I'm enjoying the weather! I finished going over the all the material for the 8 domains on the CISSP exam. I'm currently doing practice questions and just ordered the official practice exams from ISC2. Once that book arrives, I plan on ripping through those and scheduling the exam.

I'm also still on the fence between getting a Macbook Air or a used Google Pixel for future research and learning. I believe that the Google Pixel will result in more original research; but I feel like it will be much harder to make headway.
