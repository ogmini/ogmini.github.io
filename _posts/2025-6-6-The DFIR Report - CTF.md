Saw a [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kostastsale_%F0%9D%90%82%F0%9D%90%93%F0%9D%90%85-%F0%9D%90%A4%F0%9D%90%A2%F0%9D%90%9C%F0%9D%90%A4%F0%9D%90%AC-%F0%9D%90%A8%F0%9D%90%9F%F0%9D%90%9F-%F0%9D%90%A2%F0%9D%90%A7-%F0%9D%90%A5%F0%9D%90%9E%F0%9D%90%AC%F0%9D%90%AC-activity-7336437933454913537-hYeC) on LinkedIn from Kostas Tsialemis about their upcoming public CTF. I have read their site and contemplated entering one of their public CTFs in the past. Just never got the nerve to actually try it. Kostas was giving away 2 free entries and I ended up getting one. Thanks for the opportunity. 

Now I have no excuse to at least try it! It will definitely be a learning experience and a very different CTF from ones I've done in the past. A majority of the CTF challenges that I've done have focused more on desktop and mobile device forensics.
