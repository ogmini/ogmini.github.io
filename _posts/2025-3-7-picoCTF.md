Found out about [picoCTF](https://www.picoctf.org/) a few days ago and decided to give it try with a few friends as a team. I would rank all of us as newcomers to CTFs. This competition is mainly meant for High Schoolers but is open to anyone to at least experience it. It runs from 3/7/2025 to 3/17/2025 so gives us a lot of time to take on the challenges in between our normal work. This is the first time I've formed a team to compete in one of these. We're mainly just bouncing ideas off each other and sharing hints while indepedently tackling flags.

We've already solved a bunch of the flags; but obviously cannot write about them yet as the competition is ongoing. A very different competition from the Magnet Virtual Summit 2025 CTF as this is made up of very distinct and unrelated challenges. I think I prefer the more DFIR style CTFs. This one does have categories for Binary Exploitation and Reverse Engineering that I'm excited to give a shot.

At the conclusion, I'll write about my thoughts on the experience.
