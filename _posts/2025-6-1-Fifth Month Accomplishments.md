Another month and I've been at the Zeltser Challenge for five months so far and still have not missed a post. The absence of David Cowen's Sunday Funday challenges has made this a little more difficult. Though, it has forced me to channel my energy into other pursuits. Previously, I generally had a guaranteed topic or area to look at every week. I could choose to ignore it or attack it. So what happened in May?

- Multiple PRs to Kapefiles
  - Module for Windows Notepad
  - Targets for RDCMan, ChatGPT Desktop, Remote Desktop Manager
- Researched RDCMan and Remote Desktop Manager
- Completed WinFE training from Brett Shavers
- Attended the online SANS Ransomware Summit 2025

I'm thinking of submitting a presentation proposal to BSides NYC 2025. I need to finish organizing my thoughts on that one. One thing I realized recently was the importance and usefulness to personal growth in contributing to open source projects. Anyone can help advance the body of knowledge in their field by just diving in. I have a feeling keeping my streak of posts is about to get much harder as it is summer. A lot of vacations planned.
