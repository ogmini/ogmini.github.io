August started strong and ended with chaos. Being in the ER for family is not fun; but all is well now. Minus some missed posts. We're at the eighth month of the Zeltser Challenge from David Cowen and I'm still enjoying everything and it has really pushed me to go outside of my comfort area. 

I'm continuing to do writeups for the BelkaCTF 7 and plan on doing a full mock report that might be presented to an audience.

Ongoing work on making contributions to the following projects:
- Velociraptor - [https://ogmini.github.io/tags.html#Velociraptor](https://ogmini.github.io/tags.html#Velociraptor)
- Registry Plugin - [https://ogmini.github.io/tags.html#RegistryPlugins](https://ogmini.github.io/tags.
html#RegistryPlugins)
- ALEAPP - [https://ogmini.github.io/tags.html#ALEAPP](https://ogmini.github.io/tags.html#ALEAPP)

Started researching a few things:
- Windows Snipping Tool - [https://ogmini.github.io/tags.html#Snipping-Tool](https://ogmini.github.io/tags.html#Snipping-Tool)
- Memory Forensics for Windows Notepad - [https://ogmini.github.io/tags.html#Memory-Forensics](https://ogmini.github.io/tags.html#Memory-Forensics)

My talk at BSides NYC is also fast approaching on October 18, 2025. Registration hasn't opened yet - [https://bsidesnyc.org/](https://bsidesnyc.org/). I feel ready with my slides, contact/business cards, and some fun stickers. Taking some advice from Jessica Hyde and Debbie Garner from their Truth in Data podcast - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skHt-pz78sI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skHt-pz78sI). I made sure to have some business cards with space to write notes! Hope to also get some other people's business cards.

I also have a stretch goal of submitting a Volatility 3 plugin to their 2025 contest. We'll see if I can make it happen.
