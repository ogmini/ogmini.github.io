I noticed during BelkaCTF 7 that ALEAPP didn't extract all the emails as Belkasoft. This of course led me down the path of seeing how I could go about writing one and contributing it to the project. I actually wrote about this in yesterday's [post](https://ogmini.github.io/2025/08/19/BelkaCTF-7-AAR-Workspace.html) and how to recover the information manually.

Spent some time today looking at other plugins to understand how they work and writing this plugin. I'll probably submit the PR later today or tomorrow.
