The fourth month of the Zeltser Challenge has been rather successful now that I'm looking back on my posts. I buckled down and finished reading all the material for the CISSP examination. I'm currently doing practice exams. I also participated and won three of David Cowen's Sunday Funday Challenges:

- Cloud Log Availability Delays
- WSL Docker Artifacts
- Browser Password Extraction Evidence

He also posted a FAT32 challenge but hasn't announced the results.

I finally started documenting the changes to the Windows Notepad Tab State files and its general behavior over the various versions. I pinpointed what version(s) introduced some pretty big changes to what is stored in the Tab State files. 

I also released v1.0.4 of Windows Notepad Parser to fix some little bugs and also prepare it for a KAPE Module.
