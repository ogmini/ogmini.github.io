Belkasoft is offering a free course and certification on Windows Forensics using their software. More details can be found at this link - [https://belkasoft.com/windows-forensics-training](https://belkasoft.com/windows-forensics-training). It also provides 6 CPE credits. I just signed up and I'm hoping to complete the course this weekend. The content is obviously centered around using their tools and should be a nice introduction to them. I intend on using other free tools to get the same results. I've personally found it very educating to use multiple tools to retrieve and view artifacts from different lenses. After I complete the course, I'll be posting about my impressions and thoughts.

I am a little miffed that I can't run their software in a VM.
