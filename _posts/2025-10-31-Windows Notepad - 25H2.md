Windows 11 25H2 started being pushed out as an update in October 2025 and today we're going to be looking if anything has changed with Windows Notepad version 11.2507.26.0. This is what I've found/noticed so far:

- Changes in Copilot options
  - There is a "Write" option
- Markdown Formatted/Syntax option
  - You can flip between Formatted Markdown with a toolbar or Syntax Markdown

This has resulted in another value to the [More Options Block](https://github.com/ogmini/Notepad-State-Library?tab=readme-ov-file#more-options-block). There are now three possible values for the formatting:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Unformatted |
| 2 | Markdown Formatted (Toolbar)|
| 3 | Markdown Syntax (No Toolbar)|

I need to start looking at the Copilot integration again as they are pushing more and more AI features. Some of the new features require a Copilot+ PC.
