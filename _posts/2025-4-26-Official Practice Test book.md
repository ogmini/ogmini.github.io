Got my "Official Practice Tests" book from ISC2 this week and spent some time doing some questions today. I did not realize that it actually has 100 questions on the 8 domains AND four practice tests. I'm hoping to get through all the questions by mid-May with a goal of trying to schedule an exam for April. I recall that test times/dates fill up pretty quick around me when I scheduled my CSSLP exam. 

Finally purchased a Macbook Air M4 that should be here next week. It should assist greatly in learning MacOS Forensics and doing future research. This is something that I've pushed off for a long time as my professional life has always been Windows/Linux centric.
