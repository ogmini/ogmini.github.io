**Happy New Year and welcome to 2025!**

[David Cowen](https://www.hecfblog.com/) issued the Zeltser Challenge over on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dcowen_its-never-too-early-to-plan-how-your-next-activity-7270149551326453760-mM9j?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) for 2025. I can't think of a better way to document and provide motivation for my career pivot. I'm excited to take this challenge and hopefully the group aspect will keep us all on track.

For anyone unaware of what the Zeltser Challenge is, you essentially post daily about pretty much anything that interests you. Helping spur learning, knowledge sharing, and make connections. If you want more details, I'll let Lenny Zeltser speak for himself on his blog [Zeltser Challenge](https://zeltser.com/2010-retrospective-on-my-security-blog/)

## THE PLAN

What follows is my weekly outline. As we all know, no plan survives first contact with the enemy. Expect changes and updates and deviations.
