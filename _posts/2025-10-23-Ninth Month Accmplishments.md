Late recap for September. We're almost done with October at this point! A bunch of missed posts; but, September is one of the busiest months for work as it is the start of a new academic year. 

Most of September's posts and research focused on the Pixel 7 I picked up and Android Foreniscs. I've shelved looking at writing a Volatility 3 plugin for Windows Notepad at the moment. I need to do some reading to really understand some of the underlying structures. It feels like I'm just flailing around and just finding things. That process should be more considered to be efficient and useful. 

I need to get back to finishing a few projects left on the burner including:

- settings.dat registry plugin
- Windows Snipping Tool
