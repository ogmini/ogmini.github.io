Running out of time to register at [https://belkasoft.com/belkactf7/](https://belkasoft.com/belkactf7/) for the BelkaCTF #7: Stranger Dfings on July 25th! As of writing this post, there are just under 1000 participants. I've prepped my workstation and I'm as ready as I'm ever going to be. On their LinkedIn page, they've dropped a few "warm up" tasks/hints from previous CTFs:

- BelkaCTF #6 - Task N3
- BelkaCTF #6 - Taks N5

One interesting thing they mentioned is the use of BelkaGPT. Might be worth giving it a whirl and seeing how it performs. [https://belkasoft.com/belkagpt](https://belkasoft.com/belkagpt).
