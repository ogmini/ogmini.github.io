When David Cowen posed this challenge for 2025, I knew it wouldn't be easy. I may have underestimated how hard it would be though...

Like many others, I suffer from impostor syndrome. The compulsion to always compare your success to the success of others around you is hard to shake. Social media has made this worse with it constantly blasting stories of successful people at you.

As many of my friends like to joke, "Never stop posting". I intend to never stop posting. Not every post has to be a doctoral thesis or literary masterpiece. They may not even be full thoughts with a conclusion. They could just be a setup for the next post or the next next post.

With that, here is my setup for a future post. I came across an old post on LinkedIn by Britton White [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/learning-opportunities-from-ransomware-redline-events-britton-white/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/learning-opportunities-from-ransomware-redline-events-britton-white/) that talked about ransomeware and a university. His main highlight at the end is that companies might want to think about incorporating checking for data breaches associated with an applicants/employees email addresses. I want to focus on something else though and for me his article gave an actual case of something I've always been concerned with working in Higher Education. Our students are the weakest link. Student employees are an even bigger weakness.
