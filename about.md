Hi, I'm Chris, also known as ogmini. My online alias reflects my passion for owning and driving a 1961 Austin Mini Mk1. With over 15 years of experience in system administration, application development, and management, I'm now transitioning into the field of Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR). To support this career shift, I earned my Master's in Digital Forensic Science from Champlain College in December 2023. As I continue to explore and learn, this blog will document my journey toward a new career in DFIR. I'm excited to apply my background in system administration and application development to this evolving field.
